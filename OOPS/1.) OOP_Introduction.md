# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects." These objects can contain **data** (attributes or properties) and **methods** (functions or behaviors). OOP is designed to manage complexity in large software systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces.

## Key Concepts of OOP

1. **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that the objects will have.
   - Example: `class Car { ... }`

2. **Object**: An instance of a class. It represents an actual entity that you can manipulate.
   - Example: `Car myCar = new Car();`

3. **Encapsulation**: The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.
   - Example: Using `private` and `public` access modifiers to control access to variables and methods.

4. **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class, allowing code reuse and extension.
   - Example: `class ElectricCar extends Car { ... }`

5. **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to respond to the same method in their own way. It allows for flexibility and the use of a single interface to interact with objects of different types.
   - Example: Method Overriding.

6. **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts, making it easier to interact with the system.
   - Example: Using abstract classes or interfaces.

## Why Do We Need OOP?

1. **Modularity**: By dividing a program into smaller parts (classes and objects), it becomes easier to manage, understand, and maintain. Each part can be developed independently.

2. **Reusability**: Once a class is created, it can be reused in different programs. You donâ€™t have to write the same code again. Inheritance also allows extending existing classes without modifying them.

3. **Maintainability**: OOP makes it easier to modify or update parts of a system without affecting the rest. Changes to one part of the code do not necessarily require changes to other parts, especially if encapsulation and abstraction are used correctly.

4. **Scalability**: OOP is suitable for large systems and is designed to handle complexity. Adding new features or maintaining large codebases is easier with OOP principles.

5. **Data Security**: Encapsulation allows for controlled access to data, ensuring that internal data of a class can only be modified by its methods, leading to more secure and reliable code.

6. **Flexibility Through Polymorphism**: The ability to define one interface but have multiple implementations allows for more flexible and extensible code. This makes it easier to introduce new functionality without breaking the existing code.

## Example: Car Class in OOP
```cpp
class Car {
private:
    string brand;
    int speed;

public:
    Car(string b, int s) : brand(b), speed(s) {}

    void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
        cout << brand << " is going at " << speed << " km/h." << endl;
    }
};
```
