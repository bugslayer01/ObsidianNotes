# Big Data Analytics

### Definition 
- A field that involves examination of large data sets to uncover hidden patterns ,correlations and insights enabling data driven decision making
### Key Techniques
- Data mining, data visualization, predictive analytics, clustering, and real-time processing.

## Structured data

-  Data that can be processed, stored, and retrieved in a fixed format. 
-  It refers to highly organized information that can be readily and seamlessly stored and accessed from a database by simple search engine algorithms. 
- Example-The employee table in a company database will be structured as the employee details, their job positions, their salaries, etc., will be present in an organized manner
