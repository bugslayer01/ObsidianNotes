# Quick update of last six days 

so nothing goes as planed i did was unable to follow my commitments that i made 
i was not waking up early , i was having any exercise  , was unable to focus on my studies  and was not able to journal my days but on the good side i was able to reduce my screen time by a bit and was able to identify problems that lead to me unable to follow my schedule

# Things that I was unable to do and  and reasons why I  not able to do them

  **1.**  I was not able to wake up early
	 **how to improve**
	     I was trying to reduce my time by a lot . Now I plan to reduce my time gradually 
**2.** did not journal
     **how to improve**
          I usually to postpone writing journal to next morning  that was the issue I think 
**3.** did not quit fap
     **how to improve**
	      Now I am thinking to just block these sites directly from my router and I usually do I at night when I am using my phone
